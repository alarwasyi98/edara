# Session Log — EDARA

> Layer 3: Episodic memory — what happened, when, and what changed.
> Append new sessions at the top. Never delete old entries.

## Current State Summary (as of Session 33)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Branch | Do not trust this file for live branch state; verify with `git status` / `git log` |
| SHA | Verify current SHA from git before acting on branch-sensitive work |
| Last PR | #27 (feat: complete class management frontend) |
| CI | Build pipeline fixed (OOM + missing SSR entry). Last full `pnpm build` passed cleanly. |
| Deployment | https://edara.vercel.app/ (working, login functional) |
| Next Step | **Advance to Section 9 Step 26 — Student Frontend** |

### Current Implementation Snapshot

**What's Done:**
- Sections 1–8 are complete through Step 22, and Section 9 Steps 23–25 are complete
- Live today: auth runtime, tenant/school-unit flows, academic years, dashboard, activity logs, full Teacher Management including list/detail/create/update/deactivate plus bulk import preview/partial import and filtered Excel export, full Class Management frontend/backend wiring including grouped cards, class detail roster, create/update, and transactional mass promotion, and Student API Router with all 6 procedures (`list`, `create`, `update`, `getById`, `changeStatus`, `getStatusHistory`) implemented and passing build
- Section 9 onward still remains to be migrated from mock-backed frontend and/or missing domain routers/UI surfaces: student frontend, SPP, cashflow, and events

**Next Actions:**
1. Treat `docs/implementation-plan.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.agents/memory/project.md`, and this log as the AI-facing source of truth for feature status
2. Verify branch/SHA directly from git before doing branch-sensitive work
3. Start Section 9 Step 26 (Student Frontend) and preserve the current class frontend/teacher import-export behavior unless requirements change

## Session 34 — 2026-05-30: PR #28 Step 25 Hardening

**Scope:** Tighten the draft Student API Router PR by fixing backend-only blockers: scoped validation, distinct student pagination, audit logging, migration drift, and backend regression coverage.

### What Happened
- Hardened `src/server/routers/students/index.ts` so `list` pages/counts distinct students instead of joined enrollment rows, `create` validates class/year scope and class-year consistency, duplicate NISN returns structured `CONFLICT`, `changeStatus` + `getStatusHistory` enforce both school and unit scope, and student mutations now use `withActivityLog`.
- Added focused regression coverage in `src/server/routers/students/index.test.ts` for student-list deduplication, duplicate NISN conflicts, class-year mismatch rejection, update duplicate conflict handling, and cross-unit status-history access.
- Added custom migration `drizzle/0003_fix_enrollment_status_history.sql` plus matching `drizzle/meta/0003_snapshot.json` / `_journal.json` to align `enrollment_status_history` with the live schema (`old_status`, `new_status`, `changed_by uuid -> user.id`, `changed_at` with timezone).
- Corrected AI-facing docs so Step 25 now states `getById` returns profile + enrollment history, while payment history remains deferred to later SPP-backed student-detail work.

### Why It Matters
This keeps PR #28 backend-only while making the student router merge-safer: pagination counts are stable, tenant boundaries are enforced consistently, audit logs match project rules, and Drizzle metadata no longer drifts from the checked-in schema.

### Verification
- `pnpm test:run -- src/server/routers/students/index.test.ts` passed
- `pnpm typecheck` passed
- `pnpm build` passed

### Files Changed
- `src/server/routers/students/index.ts` — hardened list/mutations/scope checks and added activity logging
- `src/server/routers/students/index.test.ts` — new backend regression tests
- `drizzle/0003_fix_enrollment_status_history.sql` — new custom migration
- `drizzle/meta/0003_snapshot.json` — aligned migration snapshot
- `drizzle/meta/_journal.json` — registered migration
- `docs/implementation-plan.md` — clarified Step 25 `getById` scope
- `.agents/memory/project.md` — aligned student feature note

## Session 33 — 2026-05-26: Section 9 Step 25 — Student API Router

**Scope:** Implement `studentsRouter` with all 6 procedures (`list`, `create`, `update`, `getById`, `changeStatus`, `getStatusHistory`), register in `appRouter`, and verify build passes.

### What Happened
Created `src/server/routers/students/index.ts` with tenant-scoped student router implementing:
- `list`: paginated with server-side search/filter by class/status/search term
- `create`: dual insert transaction (students + enrollments) with NISN uniqueness per school
- `update`: student profile updates
- `getById`: combined student profile + enrollment history for detail page (payment history deferred to later SPP-backed work)
- `changeStatus`: writes to `enrollment_status_history` with old_status, new_status, changed_by, metadata (supports transfer, graduate, dropout)
- `getStatusHistory`: retrieves full status transition history

Created `src/lib/validators/students.ts` with comprehensive Zod schemas for all operations including import/export schemas (following teacher pattern).

Verified `src/server/db/schema/enrollments.ts` contains `enrollmentStatusHistory` table (lines 80–95) with proper relations and `enrollmentStatusEnum` includes all required statuses (`active`, `promoted`, `graduated`, `transferred_out`, `inactive`).

Registered `students` router in `src/server/routers/app-router.ts` (lines 107–114).

### Why It Matters
This completes the Student API Router backend foundation, enabling the Student Frontend implementation in Step 26. All student operations now have type-safe oRPC procedures with proper tenant scoping, RLS enforcement, and pagination; payment-history detail remains a later SPP-backed follow-up.

### Verification
- `pnpm build` passed: client 4093 modules, server 1 module, ~3 minutes
- `pnpm format:check` passed
- ESLint baseline: 3 errors, 9 warnings in 12 files
- LSP diagnostics clean on all modified files
- Router registered and verified in `app-router.ts`

### Files Changed
- `src/server/routers/students/index.ts` — new: studentsRouter with 6 procedures
- `src/lib/validators/students.ts` — new: comprehensive Zod schemas
- `src/server/routers/app-router.ts` — registered students router (lines 107–114)

## Session 32 — 2026-05-21: Fix Production Build Pipeline (OOM + SSR Bridge)

**Scope:** Fix `pnpm build` which was broken by a JS heap OOM during Nitro SSR bundling and a missing `dist/server/server.js` after Nitro migrated to `.nitro/vite/services/ssr/`.

### What Happened
Diagnosed two build failures:
1. **OOM** — `FATAL ERROR: Reached heap limit Allocation failed - JavaScript heap out of memory` during Nitro SSR bundling (client build consumed most of the default 2GB heap before Nitro ran). Fixed by adding `.npmrc` with `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=4096`.
2. **Missing `dist/server/server.js`** — After fixing OOM, the preview server failed with `Cannot find module 'dist/server/server.js'` because Nitro/Vercel preset redirects SSR output to `node_modules/.nitro/vite/services/ssr/index.js` instead of the expected `dist/server/server.js`. Fixed by adding a custom Vite plugin `nitro-ssr-bridge` that copies the entire SSR output directory (including `assets/`) to `dist/server/` via `cpSync`.

### Why It Matters
Without a working build, CI would fail on every PR. The `.npmrc` bump and nitro-ssr-bridge are low-touch, low-risk changes that unblock the CI pipeline without altering the app logic.

### Verification
- `pnpm build` completed successfully:
  - Client: ✓ built in 50.26s
  - Nitro SSR: ✓ built in 1m 31s (4549 modules, Vercel preset)
  - Prerender: 1 page (/) rendered successfully
- No errors, only baseline warnings (chunk size, "use client" directive, unused devtools imports)

### Files Changed
- `.npmrc` — Added `node-options=--max-old-space-size=4096`
- `vite.config.ts` — Added `nitroSSRBridgePlugin`; replaced `copyFileSync` import with `cpSync`

## Session 31 — 2026-05-20: Section 9 Step 24 — Class Frontend

**Scope:** Replace the mock Class Management frontend with live oRPC/TanStack Query wiring on the current branch, reusing the existing backend router and existing teacher/academic-year query patterns.

### What Happened
Rebuilt `src/features/classes/index.tsx` to use live `tenant.classes.list` data grouped by grade, live academic-year selection from `tenant.academicYears.list`, live class detail/student roster from `tenant.classes.getById`, and real create/update/mass-promotion mutations. The page now renders grouped class cards, an empty state for years with no classes, a class detail section with active students, and a mass-promotion CTA that only appears when a next academic year exists.

Added `src/features/classes/hooks/use-classes.ts`, `use-create-class.ts`, `use-update-class.ts`, `use-mass-promotion.ts`, `hooks/index.ts`, and `hooks/class-query-cache.ts` to mirror the Teacher feature hook style. Replaced the mock class dialog and row actions with live versions, added `class-grid.tsx` for grouped class cards and capacity bars, added `mass-promotion-modal.tsx` for the 3-step promotion flow, and introduced `types.ts` to keep the live response shapes explicit on the frontend.

### Why It Matters
This closes Step 24 and removes the old local/demo behavior from Class Management. The Classes domain is now live end-to-end on the frontend, which unblocks the next migration steps that depend on real class/year/student relationships.

### Verification
- LSP diagnostics returned clean results for all modified files under `src/features/classes/` and for `src/routes/_authenticated/classes/index.tsx`
- `pnpm format:check` passed
- `pnpm typecheck` passed
- `pnpm test:run` passed (4 files, 19 tests)
- `rtk lint --max-warnings 10` passed with 0 errors and 9 baseline warnings
- `pnpm build` passed; remaining output was baseline bundle/runtime warnings only

### Follow-up Notes
- Oracle review identified and I fixed two release-blocking UX/correctness gaps before closing the step: `src/features/classes/index.tsx` now renders an explicit error state when `classDetailQuery` fails, and `src/features/classes/components/mass-promotion-modal.tsx` now renders an explicit error state when target classes fail to load.

## Session 30 — 2026-05-20: Documentation Mental-Model Reconciliation

**Scope:** Reconcile the AI-facing architecture documentation so future sessions stop treating EDARA as a backendless/static SPA and instead use the actual SPA-rendered plus embedded-server mental model.

### What Happened
Reviewed `AGENTS.md`, `.agents/memory/system.md`, `.agents/memory/project.md`, `.agents/memory/decisions.md`, and `README.md` against the live code boundaries in `src/server.ts`, `src/routes/api/auth/$.ts`, and `src/routes/api/rpc/$.ts`.

Updated the canonical docs to describe EDARA as a **client-rendered SPA shell backed by an embedded TanStack Start/Nitro server runtime**. Clarified that “No SSR” means no server-rendered pages, route loaders, or `createServerFn` feature architecture, not “no backend runtime.” Added `ADR-008` for the corrected architecture mental model and `C10` to supersede older Better Auth runtime notes that reflected a pre-runtime migration stage.

### Why It Matters
Future AI sessions were at risk of inheriting a stale model from docs that still said “browser-only SPA,” “static hosting possible,” or implied Better Auth server wiring was absent. The updated docs now match the codebase reality: live auth and oRPC runtime boundaries exist in-repo, while some product domains remain mock/local-state on the frontend until later implementation-plan steps.

### Verification
- LSP diagnostics were clean for `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `.agents/memory/system.md`, `.agents/memory/project.md`, and `.agents/memory/decisions.md`
- No feature/runtime code changed; this session only corrected documentation and AI memory alignment

## Session 29 — 2026-05-15: Section 9 Step 23 — Class API Router

**Scope:** Implement the next migration milestone after Teacher Step 22 by creating the tenant-scoped Class API Router, validating it against the documented CI pipeline, and aligning the AI-facing docs/memory with the new post-Step-23 repo state.

### What Happened
Built `src/server/routers/classes/index.ts` and `src/lib/validators/classes.ts` to bring Class Management onto the live tenant API. The new router exposes `list`, `getById`, `create`, `update`, and `massPromotion` under `tenant.classes`, and `app-router.ts` now registers that namespace alongside the existing live domains.

The `list` procedure resolves either an explicit academic year or the active one for the current unit, then returns classes grouped by `gradeLevel` with active enrollment counts versus capacity. `getById` returns the scoped class header data plus the active student roster for that class/year. `create` and `update` validate academic year ownership and active homeroom teachers inside the current tenant scope. `update` explicitly forbids changing `academicYearId` after class creation so existing enrollments cannot be orphaned from downstream detail/promotion flows.

`massPromotion` uses a transaction on the tenant-scoped DB context, validates source enrollments and target-year classes inside the transaction boundary, writes source enrollment status changes to `promoted`, appends `enrollment_status_history` audit rows, and inserts the new target-year enrollments. After an Oracle review, the implementation was tightened further to scope teacher/student joins by tenant and to move promotion validation fully inside the transaction to reduce stale-read / unique-conflict race exposure.

### Validation
- `lsp_diagnostics` reported no issues on `src/lib/validators/classes.ts`, `src/server/routers/classes/index.ts`, and `src/server/routers/app-router.ts`
- `pnpm format:check` ✅
- `pnpm typecheck` ✅
- `rtk lint --max-warnings 10` ✅ (same pre-existing 10-warning baseline)
- `pnpm build` ✅

### Files Changed
- `src/lib/validators/classes.ts` — new class list/create/update/mass-promotion input schemas
- `src/server/routers/classes/index.ts` — new tenant classes router with grouped listing, detail, create, update, and transactional mass promotion
- `src/server/routers/app-router.ts` — registered `tenant.classes`
- `docs/implementation-plan.md` — Step 23 completion status and next-step updates
- `AGENTS.md` — current migration status updated
- `.agents/memory/project.md` — feature inventory/current-state updated
- `.agents/memory/log.md` — session log updated

## Session 28 — 2026-05-15: Section 8 Step 22 — Teacher Bulk Import & Export

**Scope:** Implement the next migration milestone after Teacher Step 21 by turning Teacher bulk import/export from placeholders into live tenant API workflows, then re-run the repo code gates and align the AI-facing docs/memory.

### What Happened
Built Step 22 around the existing flat `tenant.teachers` router shape instead of introducing a new jobs subsystem. The final flow parses uploaded Excel workbooks in the browser with `xlsx`, sends parsed rows to the server for authoritative preview validation and partial import, and generates filtered teacher exports on the server with `exceljs` as a JSON-safe base64 workbook payload for browser download.

On the server, `src/server/routers/teachers/index.ts` now exposes `previewImport`, `executeImport`, and `export` alongside the existing CRUD procedures. Validation reuses `createTeacherSchema`, detects duplicate `nik` values inside the upload batch and against existing teachers in the same `schoolId + unitId`, surfaces row-level errors and warnings, and only inserts valid selected rows during the execute step while preserving activity-log coverage on the bulk import mutation.

On the client, `src/features/teachers/components/teacher-dialogs.tsx` was rewritten from placeholders into the live 4-step import flow described in the feature stories: download template, upload workbook, preview/validate, and confirm import. The export dialog now reads the active teacher filters from route search state and downloads a filtered workbook, while `src/features/teachers/components/teacher-action-buttons.tsx` now advertises live import/export actions instead of “Belum Tersedia”.

A shared helper layer was added in `src/lib/teachers-bulk.ts` with tests in `src/lib/__tests__/teachers-bulk.test.ts`, plus new teacher import/export hooks and validator schemas. One bug surfaced during verification: worksheet row numbering initially collapsed after blank rows were skipped, so `mapTeacherBulkWorksheetRows` was corrected to preserve original Excel row numbers in validation feedback.

### Verification
- `pnpm install` succeeded after adding `exceljs` and `xlsx`
- `lsp_diagnostics` was clean on all changed teacher bulk files
- `pnpm format:check` passed
- `pnpm test:run` passed (`4` test files, `19` tests)
- `pnpm typecheck` passed
- `rtk lint --max-warnings 10` passed with the same 10 pre-existing warnings in unrelated files
- `pnpm build` passed; the known chunk-size warning still appears but does not fail the build

### Resulting State
- Section 8 is now complete through Step 22
- Teacher Management now covers TCH-01 through TCH-05 in the live app
- Next planned migration work is Section 9 Step 23 — Class API Router

---

## Session 27 — 2026-05-13: Section 8 Step 21 — Teacher Frontend Wired to Live API

**Scope:** Audit Step 20, complete Step 21 against the real teacher feature cluster, verify the live migration, and align AI memory with the resulting codebase state.

### What Happened
Confirmed Step 20 backend work was already complete, then rewired Teacher Management frontend from mock data to the live `tenant.teachers.*` API in the current repo structure. The list page now uses live paginated/filterable teacher data, the detail page uses `getById`, and create/update/deactivate flows use real mutations with invalidation and Indonesian toast handling. Teacher import/export was intentionally not implemented in Step 21; those actions now stay visible only as explicitly unavailable placeholders so the UI does not imply a live bulk workflow.

An Oracle review was used before finalizing. Its follow-up fixes tightened the migration by reusing shared validator exports from `src/lib/validators/teachers.ts`, preserving unknown live `mataPelajaran` values in edit mode, generating subject filter options from live data, disabling deactivate for already-inactive teachers, disabling misleading local sorting on the live table, and moving the add/edit form shell to the requested side-sheet pattern.

### Files Updated

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `src/features/teachers/data/schema.ts` | Added live teacher contracts, shared route-search schema/defaults, normalization helpers, status derivation, edit-form mapping, and dynamic subject-option builder while retaining legacy mock schema exports for compatibility |
| `src/features/teachers/data/schema.test.ts` | Added regression tests for route defaults, subject normalization, active/inactive derivation, edit-form defaults, and custom live subject preservation |
| `src/routes/_authenticated/teachers/index.tsx` | Switched route search validation to the shared teacher route-search schema |
| `src/features/teachers/hooks/use-teachers.ts` | Added live teacher list query hook |
| `src/features/teachers/hooks/use-teacher-by-id.ts` | Added live teacher detail query hook |
| `src/features/teachers/hooks/use-create-teacher.ts` | Added live create mutation hook with toasts and list invalidation |
| `src/features/teachers/hooks/use-update-teacher.ts` | Added live update mutation hook with list/detail invalidation |
| `src/features/teachers/hooks/use-deactivate-teacher.ts` | Added live deactivate mutation hook with list/detail invalidation |
| `src/features/teachers/hooks/teacher-query-cache.ts` | Centralized teacher list/detail invalidation helpers |
| `src/features/teachers/hooks/index.ts` | Added barrel exports for teacher hooks |
| `src/features/teachers/index.tsx` | Replaced mock teacher source with live list query and mounted live dialog set |
| `src/features/teachers/detail.tsx` | Replaced mock detail lookup with live `useTeacherById` flow and real-field rendering |
| `src/features/teachers/components/teacher-table.tsx` | Rewired to live server-side pagination/filter state, inactive toggle, live totals, inactive row styling, and dynamic subject filter options |
| `src/features/teachers/components/teacher-columns.tsx` | Replaced mock-only columns with live teacher fields and disabled misleading local sorting |
| `src/features/teachers/components/teacher-provider.tsx` | Updated provider state to use live `TeacherRecord` rows and `deactivate` dialog state |
| `src/features/teachers/components/teacher-row-actions.tsx` | Rewired actions to live teacher rows, renamed destructive action to deactivate, and disabled it for already-inactive teachers |
| `src/features/teachers/components/teacher-action-buttons.tsx` | Kept add live while marking import/export as unavailable placeholders |
| `src/features/teachers/components/teacher-dialogs.tsx` | Added live deactivate confirmation dialog and converted import/export dialogs into explicit unavailable placeholders |
| `src/features/teachers/components/teacher-add-dialog.tsx` | Rewrote add/edit flow to RHF + Zod live form, shared validators, side-sheet UI, live subject preservation, and real create/update mutations |
| `src/lib/validators/teachers.ts` | Exported reusable teacher enum/value schemas for frontend validator reuse |
| `.agents/memory/project.md` | Updated project memory to reflect Step 21 completion |
| `.agents/memory/log.md` | Recorded this session and advanced the top-level state summary |

### Verification
- `lsp_diagnostics` on `src/features/teachers` → clean
- `pnpm test:run` → pass (3 files, 16 tests)
- `pnpm typecheck` → pass
- `pnpm lint` → pass with 10 existing warnings, no new errors
- `pnpm build` → app compiled and bundled, but prerender failed because the local workspace has no `DATABASE_URL` / runtime DB env for Neon

### Resulting State
- Step 20 backend audit verdict: complete
- Step 21 frontend wiring verdict: complete for list/detail/create/update/deactivate
- Teacher import/export remains intentionally deferred and visibly unavailable
- Remaining migrations still center on classes, students, SPP, cashflow, and events

---

## Session 26 — 2026-05-12: Section 8 Step 20 — Teacher API

**Scope:** Implement the first live Teacher Management backend slice and keep AI memory aligned with the new status.

### What Happened
Added the tenant-scoped teacher API under `tenant.teachers`, created shared teacher validators, and registered CRUD-style procedures for `list`, `getById`, `create`, `update`, and `deactivate`. The implementation follows the current oRPC/Drizzle backend patterns, keeps teacher records scoped by `schoolId` + `unitId`, supports `ilike` search plus employment-status/subject filters, and uses soft-delete via `isActive = false`.

### Files Updated

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `src/lib/validators/teachers.ts` | Added teacher list/create/update Zod schemas for the live API contract |
| `src/server/routers/teachers/index.ts` | Added tenant-scoped teacher procedures with pagination, filtering, soft-delete, and activity-log middleware |
| `src/server/routers/app-router.ts` | Registered `tenant.teachers` endpoints |
| `AGENTS.md` | Updated current status to reflect Step 20 complete and Step 21 next |
| `.agents/memory/project.md` | Updated feature inventory and milestone status for Teacher Management |
| `.agents/memory/log.md` | Recorded this session and advanced the top-level state summary |

### Verification
- `pnpm format:check`
- `pnpm typecheck`
- `rtk lint --max-warnings 10`
- `pnpm build`

All commands passed. Lint remains at the existing baseline of 10 warnings; no new errors were introduced.

---

## Session 25 — 2026-05-12: AI Memory Alignment Pass

**Scope:** Documentation-only update. No product code changed.

### What Happened
Corrected stale AI-facing memory so future agents no longer treat the repo as pre-auth, pre-oRPC, or fully mock-backed. Aligned `AGENTS.md`, `.agents/memory/project.md`, and the top summary of this log with the verified codebase state.

### Files Updated

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `AGENTS.md` | Updated Current Status to show Sections 1–7 complete through Step 19 and Section 8 as next |
| `.agents/memory/project.md` | Rewrote stale progress, feature inventory, gotchas, and auth migration notes to match live code reality |
| `.agents/memory/log.md` | Updated top-level summary to stop presenting stale branch workflow as current source of truth |

### Verified State Captured
- Live: auth runtime, tenant/unit flows, academic years, dashboard, activity logs
- Still pending/live-migration work: teachers, classes, students, SPP, cashflow, events
- Branch/SHA state should be read from git, not inferred from AI memory files

## Session 24 — 2026-05-04: Steps 18–19 Complete — Dashboard & Activity Log (Section 7)

**Branch:** `feat/dashboard` (from `dev`, 2 commits ahead)
**Commits:** `d865ad7` (Step 18), `98efc7f` (Step 19)
**Final SHA:** `98efc7f`

### What Happened
Completed Section 7: Dashboard & Activity Log. Implemented both backend API routers (Step 18) and frontend UI (Step 19). All dashboard data now fetched from live API with loading states and empty states.

### Step 18: Dashboard API Router

#### Files Created

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/lib/validators/dashboard.ts` | Zod schemas: `cashflowChartSchema` (months param), `activityLogListSchema` (pagination) |
| `src/server/routers/dashboard/index.ts` | 4 procedures: `getSummaryCards`, `getCashflowChart`, `getUpcomingEvents`, `getRecentActivity` |
| `src/server/routers/activity-logs/index.ts` | 1 procedure: `listActivityLogs` (paginated, grouped by day) |

#### Files Modified

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `src/server/routers/app-router.ts` | Registered `tenant.dashboard.{getSummaryCards, getCashflowChart, getUpcomingEvents, getRecentActivity}` and `tenant.activityLogs.{list}` |

#### API Design Details

**Dashboard Router (`tenant.dashboard`):**
- **`getSummaryCards`** — returns: `totalActiveStudents` (enrollments with status='active' in active academic year), `totalActiveTeachers` (teachers with isActive=true), `sppIncomeThisMonth` (SUM of payment_transactions with type='payment' for current month), `sppIncomeDeltaPercent` (percentage change vs previous month, computed with decimal.js)
- **`getCashflowChart`** — input: `months` (default 6), returns: array of `{ month: 'YYYY-MM', income: string, expense: string }` aggregated from cashflow_transactions, grouped by month and type
- **`getUpcomingEvents`** — returns: next 5 events where `startDate >= NOW()` and status='scheduled', ordered by startDate ASC
- **`getRecentActivity`** — returns: last 10 activity_logs for the unit, ordered by createdAt DESC

**Activity Logs Router (`tenant.activityLogs`):**
- **`listActivityLogs`** — input: pagination params, returns: paginated result with logs grouped by day (SQL `date(created_at)` as grouping key), each group contains array of log entries

### Step 19: Dashboard Frontend

#### Files Created

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/features/dashboard/hooks/use-summary-cards.ts` | `useQuery(orpc.tenant.dashboard.getSummaryCards.queryOptions({}))` |
| `src/features/dashboard/hooks/use-cashflow-chart.ts` | `useQuery(orpc.tenant.dashboard.getCashflowChart.queryOptions({ months }))` |
| `src/features/dashboard/hooks/use-upcoming-events.ts` | `useQuery(orpc.tenant.dashboard.getUpcomingEvents.queryOptions({}))` |
| `src/features/dashboard/hooks/use-recent-activity.ts` | `useQuery(orpc.tenant.dashboard.getRecentActivity.queryOptions({}))` |
| `src/features/dashboard/hooks/index.ts` | Barrel export for all dashboard hooks |

#### Files Modified

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `src/features/dashboard/index.tsx` | Wired to real hooks, replaced mock data, added loading skeletons and empty states |
| `src/features/dashboard/components/overview.tsx` | Rewritten to use `useCashflowChart()`, changed from AreaChart to BarChart, added loading/empty states |
| `src/lib/format.ts` | Added `relative` format option to `formatDate()` for activity log timestamps |

#### Key Implementation Details

**Dashboard Layout:**
- Row 1: 3 Summary Cards (Total Siswa Aktif, Total Guru Aktif, Penerimaan SPP Bulan Ini with delta badge)
- Row 2: Left 60% = Cashflow BarChart (income/expense), Right 40% = Recent Payments (kept as placeholder)
- Row 3: Left 50% = Activity Log (last 10 entries with relative timestamps), Right 50% = Upcoming Events (next 5 events)

**Loading States:**
- Summary cards: 3 skeleton cards with spinner
- Activity log: centered spinner
- Upcoming events: centered spinner
- Cashflow chart: centered spinner

**Empty States:**
- Activity log: "Belum ada aktivitas"
- Upcoming events: "Tidak ada kegiatan mendatang"
- Cashflow chart: "Belum ada data arus kas"

**Relative Time Formatting:**
- `formatDate(date, 'relative')` returns: "baru saja", "X menit lalu", "X jam lalu", "X hari lalu", "X minggu lalu", "X bulan lalu", "X tahun lalu"

### Verification
- `tsc --noEmit` → 0 errors ✅
- `eslint --max-warnings 10` → 0 errors, 11 warnings (baseline) ✅
- `lsp_diagnostics` on all dashboard files → clean ✅

## Session 23 — 2026-05-04: Step 18 Complete — Dashboard & Activity Logs API Routers

**Branch:** `feat/section-7-dashboard` (from `dev`, 1 commit ahead with doc update)
**Commit:** `bf09f6c` (doc update), implementation commits pending
**Final SHA:** (pending — work complete, not yet committed)

### What Happened
Completed Step 18: created `dashboardRouter` and `activityLogsRouter` with all required procedures. All dashboard queries are read-only, scoped by unit context, and use decimal.js for financial calculations.

### Files Created

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/lib/validators/dashboard.ts` | Zod schemas: `cashflowChartSchema` (months param), `activityLogListSchema` (pagination) |
| `src/server/routers/dashboard/index.ts` | 4 procedures: `getSummaryCards`, `getCashflowChart`, `getUpcomingEvents`, `getRecentActivity` |
| `src/server/routers/activity-logs/index.ts` | 1 procedure: `listActivityLogs` (paginated, grouped by day) |

| `src/server/routers/app-router.ts` | Registered `tenant.dashboard.{getSummaryCards, getCashflowChart, getUpcomingEvents, getRecentActivity}` and `tenant.activityLogs.{list}` |

### API Design Details

**Dashboard Router (`tenant.dashboard`):**
- **`getSummaryCards`** — returns: `totalActiveStudents` (enrollments with status='active' in active academic year), `totalActiveTeachers` (teachers with isActive=true), `sppIncomeThisMonth` (SUM of payment_transactions with type='payment' for current month), `sppIncomeDeltaPercent` (percentage change vs previous month, computed with decimal.js)
- **`getCashflowChart`** — input: `months` (default 6), returns: array of `{ month: 'YYYY-MM', income: string, expense: string }` aggregated from cashflow_transactions, grouped by month and type
- **`getUpcomingEvents`** — returns: next 5 events where `startDate >= NOW()` and status='scheduled', ordered by startDate ASC
- **`getRecentActivity`** — returns: last 10 activity_logs for the unit, ordered by createdAt DESC

**Activity Logs Router (`tenant.activityLogs`):**
- **`listActivityLogs`** — input: pagination params, returns: paginated result with logs grouped by day (SQL `date(created_at)` as grouping key), each group contains array of log entries

### Key Implementation Details
- **Active students** — computed from `enrollments` table with status='active' in the active academic year (not from `students.isActive` which doesn't exist)
- **SPP income aggregation** — uses `SUM(payment_transactions.amount)` filtered by `transactionType='payment'` and date range, all amounts handled with decimal.js
- **Delta calculation** — `(current - previous) / previous * 100`, returns `null` if previous month is zero
- **Cashflow chart** — uses `to_char(transaction_date, 'YYYY-MM')` for month grouping, pivots income/expense into separate columns
- **Date handling** — current month start/end computed with JavaScript Date, formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD` strings for SQL comparison
- **Activity log grouping** — SQL `date(created_at)` extracts day, then JavaScript `reduce()` groups by day for client consumption

### Verification
- `tsc --noEmit` → 0 errors ✅
- `lsp_diagnostics` on all new files → clean ✅
- All procedures use `authorized` middleware (read-only, no role gating)
- All queries scoped by `context.unitId` and `context.schoolId`

## Session 22 — 2025-07-17: Step 17 Complete — Academic Year Frontend Wired to Live API

**Branch:** `feature/step-17-wire-academic-years-frontend` (from `dev`, merged via PR #21 to main)
**PR:** #21 (dev → main, squash-merged)
**Final SHA:** `d170c5f` (main), `0a4e848` (dev synced via Method B merge)

### What Happened
Completed Step 17: wired the Academic Year frontend page to the live oRPC API. Replaced all mock `useState` data with `useQuery`/`useMutation` hooks. Converted form to react-hook-form + zodResolver. Added shared type definitions and status derivation logic. All CI gates passed. Merged to production via PR #21.

### Files Created/Modified

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `src/features/academic-years/types.ts` | NEW — `AcademicYearRecord` interface + `deriveStatus()` function |
| `src/features/academic-years/index.tsx` | REWRITTEN — useQuery for data, useMutation for activate, loading skeletons, AlertDialog confirmation |
| `src/features/academic-years/components/tahun-ajaran-dialog.tsx` | REWRITTEN — react-hook-form + zodResolver, create/update mutations, cache invalidation |
| `src/features/academic-years/components/tahun-ajaran-row-actions.tsx` | UPDATED — removed delete action, kept edit + activate |

### Key Decisions
- **No separate hook files** — mutations/queries inlined in components (simpler for this scope, unlike the plan's suggested separate hook files)
- **`deriveStatus()` utility** — derives UI status from `isActive` + `endDate` comparison (active/completed/upcoming)
- **Removed delete action** — no delete API exists; only edit and activate remain
- **Removed non-DB columns** — semester and keterangan columns removed from table (not in schema)
- **Dates as `yyyy-MM-dd` strings** — submitted to API in ISO date format, displayed with `formatDate()` locale helper
- **Method B sync** — used merge (not reset) because safety net blocked `git reset --hard`; content identical per `git diff --stat`

### Verification
- Prettier: ✅ pass
- TypeScript (`tsc --noEmit`): ✅ zero errors
- ESLint (`--max-warnings 10`): ✅ 0 errors, 2 known warnings
- Vite build: ✅ built successfully
- `git diff --stat main dev`: empty (branches synced)

## Session 21 — 2025-07-16: Hotfix — Disable Prerender for CI

**Branch:** `hotfix/disable-prerender` (from `dev`, merged via PR #20 to main)
**PR:** #20 (hotfix/disable-prerender → main, merged)
**Final SHA:** `ae2058a` (main and dev synced)

### What Happened
CI pipeline failed after PR #19 merge because Nitro prerendering attempted to crawl routes during build, which requires a database connection (not available in CI). Created hotfix to disable prerendering entirely since EDARA is an SPA (no SSR/prerender needed).

### Root Cause
- Nitro's default `prerender` config attempted to crawl links and prerender routes during `pnpm build`
- The build step in CI runs without `DATABASE_URL` being accessible to the Nitro prerender crawler
- SPA mode does not benefit from prerendering — all routes are client-rendered

### Files Modified

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `vite.config.ts` | Added `nitro: { prerender: { routes: [], crawlLinks: false } }` to disable prerendering |
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | Added `DATABASE_URL`, `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`, `BETTER_AUTH_URL` env vars to build step |
| `.gitignore` | Added `.vercel` directory |
| `eslint.config.js` | Added `.vercel` to eslint ignores |

### Key Decisions
- **Prerendering disabled permanently** — SPA mode means all routes are client-rendered; prerendering adds no value and causes CI failures
- **Env vars in CI** — Build step needs env vars because Nitro evaluates server code during build (even with prerender disabled, it still bundles server modules)
- **Git workflow change** — User explicitly requested: "ASK me first if you want to push and create a PR". Future sessions must ask before pushing.
- **Feature branches stay local** — User explicitly requested: "Do NOT push feature branches. Instead, merge locally to dev first then push as a PR"

### Verification
- CI pipeline passes: format:check ✅, typecheck ✅, lint ✅, build ✅
- Vercel deployment succeeds
- All feature/hotfix branches deleted after merge

## Session 20 — 2025-07-15: Steps 15–16 + Vercel Deployment Fix + White Flash Fix

**Branch:** `feature/step-15-tenant-frontend-unit-management` (from `dev`, merged locally to dev)
**PRs:** #18 (dev → main, Step 15), #19 (dev → main, Step 16 + Vercel fix + white flash fix)
**SHA after #19:** `cbd8c46`

### What Happened
Implemented Step 15 (Tenant Frontend — Unit Management & Switcher) and Step 16 (Academic Year API Router). Also fixed Vercel deployment issues and white flash between page navigations.

### Step 15: Tenant Frontend — Unit Management & Switcher

#### Files Created

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/features/settings/hooks/use-school.ts` | `useQuery(orpc.tenant.schools.get.queryOptions({}))` — fetches school with units relation |
| `src/features/settings/hooks/use-units.ts` | Derives units array from `useSchool()` data via `useMemo` |
| `src/features/settings/hooks/use-create-unit.ts` | `useMutation(orpc.tenant.units.create.mutationOptions({...}))` — invalidates `orpc.tenant.schools.key()` |
| `src/features/settings/hooks/use-update-unit.ts` | `useMutation(orpc.tenant.units.update.mutationOptions({...}))` — invalidates `orpc.tenant.schools.key()` |
| `src/features/settings/hooks/index.ts` | Barrel export for all settings hooks |

#### Files Modified

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `src/features/settings/components/unit-grid.tsx` | Wired to `useUnits()` hook, replaced mock data |
| `src/features/settings/components/unit-card.tsx` | Updated to use real data types from API |
| `src/features/settings/components/unit-form-drawer.tsx` | Wired to `useCreateUnit()`/`useUpdateUnit()` with RHF + zodResolver(createUnitSchema) |
| `src/stores/tenant-store.ts` | Rewritten to use oRPC data via `useSyncTenant` pattern |
| `src/components/layout/tenant-switcher.tsx` | Wired to real unit list from Zustand store |

#### Key Patterns Established
- **Hook pattern:** `useQuery(orpc.X.queryOptions({}))` for reads, `useMutation(orpc.X.mutationOptions({...}))` for writes
- **Cache invalidation:** Mutations invalidate `orpc.tenant.schools.key()` since units are read from school relation
- **Form pattern:** react-hook-form + `zodResolver(schema)` + shadcn Form components
- **Zustand sync:** `useSyncTenant` populates store from API; tenant-switcher reads from store

### Step 16: Academic Year API Router

#### Files Created

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/server/routers/academic-years/index.ts` | 5 procedures: `listAcademicYears`, `getActiveAcademicYear`, `createAcademicYear`, `updateAcademicYear`, `activateAcademicYear` |
| `src/lib/validators/academic-years.ts` | `createAcademicYearSchema` (name YYYY/YYYY regex, startDate, endDate with refine), `updateAcademicYearSchema` |

#### Files Modified

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `src/server/routers/app-router.ts` | Registered `tenant.academicYears.{list, getActive, create, update, activate}` |

#### API Design Details
- **`listAcademicYears`** — uses `authorized` middleware, queries by `context.unitId`, ordered by `startDate DESC`
- **`getActiveAcademicYear`** — returns active year or `null`
- **`createAcademicYear`** — uses `tenantAdmin` (super_admin + kepala_sekolah), validates date overlap via `checkDateOverlap()` helper
- **`updateAcademicYear`** — validates date overlap excluding self, checks `startDate < endDate`
- **`activateAcademicYear`** — B2 exclusive activation: deactivates current active → activates target, all within RLS transaction (`context.tx`)
- **Date overlap validation** — `checkDateOverlap()` uses `lte(startDate, endDate) AND gte(endDate, startDate)` pattern

### Vercel Deployment Fix

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Nitro preset not set | Added `nitro: { preset: 'vercel' }` to vite.config.ts |
| `vercel.json` catch-all rewrite blocking `/api/*` | Deleted `vercel.json` entirely (Nitro handles routing) |
| Better Auth `trustedOrigins` | Added `https://edara.vercel.app` to Better Auth config |

### White Flash Fix

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| White flash between page navigations | Added `defaultPendingComponent` (Loader2 spinner), `defaultPendingMs: 200`, `defaultPendingMinMs: 300` to `src/router.tsx` |

### Verification
- `tsc --noEmit` → 0 errors ✅
- `eslint` → 0 errors ✅
- `pnpm build` → passes ✅
- Vercel deployment → https://edara.vercel.app/ working ✅
- Login flow → working end-to-end ✅

## Session 19 — 2025-07-15: Step 14 — Tenant & Unit API Routers

**Branch:** `feature/step-14-tenant-unit-routers` (from `dev`, merged and deleted)
**PR:** #15 (feature → dev), #16 (dev → main, merged)
**Final SHA:** `309bfd5` (main and dev synced)

### What Happened
Implemented Section 5, Step 14 of the implementation plan: Tenant & Unit API Routers. Created school and unit CRUD procedures, Zod validators with NPSN validation, and registered the tenant router in the app router.

### Files Created

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/lib/validators/tenant.ts` | Zod schemas: `npsnSchema` (8-digit regex), `updateSchoolSchema`, `createUnitSchema`, `updateUnitSchema` |
| `src/server/routers/tenant/index.ts` | Barrel export for tenant router procedures |
| `src/server/routers/tenant/schools.ts` | `getSchool`, `updateSchool` — uses `authOnly` base (no unit context) |
| `src/server/routers/tenant/units.ts` | `listUnits`, `getUnitById`, `createUnit`, `updateUnit` — uses `authorized` base with RLS |

### Files Modified

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `src/server/routers/authorized.ts` | Extracted `authOnly = base.use(authMiddleware)`, refactored `authorized = authOnly.use(requireUnitContextMiddleware)` |
| `src/server/routers/app-router.ts` | Registered `tenant.schools.{get, update}` and `tenant.units.{list, getById, create, update}` |

### Key Decisions
- **`authOnly` middleware layer** — `schools.get/update` don't need RLS/unit context; they resolve the user's school from their assignment via `resolveAssignment()` and use `db` directly (not `context.tx`)
- **Validators in `src/lib/validators/`** — per plan, positioned for future client-side form reuse with react-hook-form + zodResolver
- **Tenant-scoped queries** — all unit operations filter by `context.schoolId` as defense-in-depth alongside PostgreSQL RLS
- **Role gating** — unit mutations restricted to `super_admin` and `kepala_sekolah` via `tenantAdmin = authorized.use(requireRole([...]))`

### Verification
- `tsc --noEmit` → 0 errors
- `eslint` → 0 errors (fixed one duplicate import)
- PR #16 merged dev → main, both branches synced to same SHA

## Session 18 — 2025-07-14: Steps 12–13 — oRPC Foundation & Root Router

**Branch:** `feature/step-12-13-orpc-foundation` (from `dev`)
**Commit:** `5a9bac3` (reset, will recommit with log update)

### What Happened
Implemented Section 4 of the implementation plan: oRPC Foundation & Root Router (Steps 12–13). Created the full oRPC server-to-client pipeline and shared API utilities.

### Files Created

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/server/routers/app-router.ts` | Root `appRouter` — plain object composing `admin.users` domain router |
| `src/server/routers/index.ts` | Barrel exporting `appRouter` + `AppRouter` type |
| `src/routes/api/rpc/$.ts` | Catch-all handler wiring oRPC `RPCHandler` to `/api/rpc/*` via `createFileRoute` + `server.handlers` |
| `src/lib/orpc-client.ts` | Typed `RouterClient<AppRouter>` with `RPCLink` + `credentials: 'include'` for cookie auth |
| `src/lib/orpc-react.ts` | `orpc` TanStack Query utils via `createTanstackQueryUtils(client)` |
| `src/server/shared/validators.ts` | Shared Zod v4 validators: `uuidSchema`, `idParam`, `paginationSchema`, `paginationToOffset`, `PaginatedResult<T>`, `paginate()`, `dateRangeSchema`, `searchSchema`, `sortDirectionSchema`, `sortableSchema(columns)` |
| `src/server/shared/errors.ts` | Error helpers (all `: never`): `notFound`, `unauthorized`, `forbidden`, `badRequest`, `conflict`, `internalError` — all throw `ORPCError` |
| `src/server/shared/index.ts` | Barrel re-exporting all shared validators + errors |

### Key Decisions
- **Router as plain object** — oRPC v1 uses plain JS objects with procedures as values (no `createRouter` needed)
- **Shared validators in `src/server/shared/`** — not `src/lib/validators/` as originally planned, to keep server-only code separate
- **Error helpers return `: never`** — enables TypeScript narrowing after throw
- **`RPCHandler` from `@orpc/server/fetch`** — Fetch API compatible handler for Nitro runtime
- **`RouterClient` from `@orpc/server`** — typed client type (not from `@orpc/client`)

### Verification
- `tsc --noEmit` → 0 errors ✅
- `eslint` on all 8 new files → 0 errors ✅

## Session 17 — 2026-04-30: Step 9 — Auth API Route (Blockers Log)

**Branch:** `backup/step0-plan-update`
**Commit:** (pending — changes staged, not yet committed)

### What Happened
Implemented Step 9 (Auth API Route Handler) and encountered multiple blockers that required debugging and resolution before the route could function.

### Blockers Encountered

#### Blocker 1: `createAPIFileRoute` Does Not Exist in SPA Mode
- **Problem:** Oracle agent recommended using `createAPIFileRoute('/api/auth/$')` for the auth catch-all handler, which is the documented pattern for TanStack Start API routes. However, this export does not exist in `@tanstack/react-start@1.167.50` when running in SPA mode.
- **Root Cause:** TanStack Start SPA mode (`spa: { enabled: true }`) does not expose `createAPIFileRoute` — it only provides `createFileRoute` with `server.handlers` as the escape hatch for API routes.
- **Resolution:** Used `createFileRoute('/api/auth/$')` with `server.handlers` property instead. This is the pattern used by t3-turbo and Better Auth CLI scaffolding.

#### Blocker 2: `window is not defined` — SSR Module Evaluation
- **Problem:** After creating the auth route, the dev server crashed with `ReferenceError: window is not defined` in `auth-client.ts`.
- **Root Cause:** `auth-client.ts` used `window.location.origin` at module-level scope to set `baseURL`. TanStack Start evaluates ALL route modules on the server side (even in SPA mode) to build the route tree. This means any module imported by a route file gets executed in a Node.js context where `window` does not exist.
- **Resolution:** Added a guard: `typeof window !== 'undefined' ? window.location.origin : 'http://localhost:3000'` as the `baseURL` fallback.

#### Blocker 3: `matchMedia is not a function` — Theme Provider SSR Crash
- **Problem:** After fixing the window guard, the server crashed again with `TypeError: matchMedia is not a function` in `theme-provider.tsx`.
- **Root Cause:** Same SSR module evaluation issue. `theme-provider.tsx` called `window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)')` at module level to determine the default theme.
- **Resolution:** Added SSR guard: `typeof window !== 'undefined' && typeof window.matchMedia === 'function'` before calling `matchMedia`.

#### Blocker 4: TanStack Version Mismatch — `router.stores.matches.get()` Crash
- **Problem:** After fixing SSR guards, the main page (`/`) returned HTTP 500 with error: `TypeError: router.stores.matches.get is not a function` at `ssr-server.js:142`.
- **Root Cause:** `package.json` used caret ranges (`^1.x.x`) for TanStack packages, causing `pnpm` to resolve two different versions of `@tanstack/router-core`: v1.168.3 (from `react-router`) and v1.168.17 (from `react-start`). The `ssr-server.js` module expected the `.stores.matches.get()` API from v1.168.15+, but the router instance was created with v1.168.3 which uses a different internal API.
- **Resolution:** Pinned ALL TanStack packages to exact versions (no caret):
  - `@tanstack/react-router`: `1.168.25`
  - `@tanstack/react-start`: `1.167.50`
  - `@tanstack/router-devtools`: `1.166.13`
  - Removed redundant devDeps: `@tanstack/router-plugin`, `@tanstack/start-client-core`, `@tanstack/start-server-core`
  - After `pnpm install`, all packages resolve to single `router-core@1.168.17`

#### Blocker 5: `QueryClientProvider` Duplication
- **Problem:** `__root.tsx` wrapped children in `QueryClientProvider`, but `router.tsx` also wrapped via `Wrap` option — causing React context duplication warnings.
- **Resolution:** Removed `QueryClientProvider` from `__root.tsx`, kept it only in `router.tsx`'s `Wrap` option (single source of truth).

#### Blocker 6: Dev Server Process Management
- **Problem:** After fixing all code issues, could not verify the fix because `curl` returned HTTP 000 (connection refused). Vite reported "ready" but port 3000 was not listening.
- **Root Cause:** The bash tool kills processes after timeout. `pnpm dev` was started with a 20s timeout, Vite reported ready within that window, but the process was killed when the timeout expired. PowerShell `Start-Job` also failed because background jobs run in isolated process spaces that don't bind ports to the host.
- **Resolution:** Used `[System.Diagnostics.Process]::Start()` to spawn a truly detached `cmd.exe /c pnpm dev` process. Vite bound to `[::1]:3000` (IPv6 localhost). Curl needed `http://[::1]:3000/` to connect.

### Files Changed
- `src/routes/api/auth/$.ts` — NEW: Better Auth catch-all handler using `createFileRoute` + `server.handlers`
- `src/lib/auth-client.ts` — SSR guard for `window.location.origin`
- `src/context/theme-provider.tsx` — SSR guard for `window.matchMedia`
- `src/router.tsx` — Added `dehydrate`/`hydrate`/`Wrap` with QueryClientProvider
- `src/routes/__root.tsx` — Removed duplicate QueryClientProvider
- `package.json` — Pinned TanStack versions, removed redundant devDeps
- `pnpm-lock.yaml` — Regenerated with pinned versions
- `src/routeTree.gen.ts` — Regenerated to include `/api/auth/$` route

### Verification
- `/api/auth/ok` → `{"ok":true}` HTTP 200 ✅
- `/` → Full HTML document HTTP 200 (4619 bytes) ✅
- `tsc --noEmit` → 0 errors ✅
- `vite dev` → starts on port 3000 ✅

### Key Takeaway
TanStack Start SPA mode is NOT a pure client-side SPA — it still evaluates route modules on the server to build the route tree and handle API routes via Nitro. Any module-level code that references browser APIs (`window`, `document`, `matchMedia`) will crash the server. All browser API usage must be guarded with `typeof window !== 'undefined'` checks or deferred to `useEffect`/runtime.

## Session 15 — 2026-04-29: Step 0 — TanStack Start SPA Migration

**Branch:** `backup/step0-plan-update`
**Commits:** `c6bb610` (docs) → `2247d7b` (feat)

### What Happened
Identified that the implementation plan was missing a critical prerequisite: migrating from plain Vite SPA to TanStack Start SPA mode. Steps 9 (auth API route) and 12 (oRPC API route) require server-side API routes via Nitro, which only TanStack Start provides.

### Phase 1: Plan Update (`c6bb610`)
- Added **Section 2.5 — Step 0** to `docs/implementation-plan.md` with 9 sub-tasks
- Updated dependency graph: Step 0 → Step 8 → Step 9 → Step 10 → Step 11
- Updated Steps 8, 9, 12 to reference Step 0 as dependency
- Updated Appendix A (PRD traceability), B (dependency graph), C (known issues)
- Total steps: 40 → 41

### Phase 2: Execution (`2247d7b`)
Migrated from `@tanstack/react-router` + plain Vite to `@tanstack/react-start` SPA mode:

| File | Action |
|------|--------|
| `src/client.tsx` | Created — `hydrateRoot(document, <StartClient />)` |
| `src/server.ts` | Created — `createServerEntry` with Nitro handler |
| `src/router.tsx` | Created — `getRouter()` factory + QueryClient context |
| `src/routes/__root.tsx` | Rewritten — full HTML document + `head()` with meta/OG/fonts |
| `vite.config.ts` | Updated — `tanstackStart({ spa: true })` + `nitro()` + `tsconfigPaths` |
| `package.json` | Updated — `@tanstack/react-start` + `nitro` to deps, removed `@rsbuild/core` |
| `index.html` | Deleted — replaced by `__root.tsx` `head()` |
| `src/main.tsx` | Deleted — Start manages entry points |
| `.gitignore` | Updated — added `.output/` |

### Research Findings
- TanStack Query + Table are framework-agnostic (no migration benefit from Start)
- Start adds: server functions, API routes, SSR, Nitro runtime
- SPA mode (`spa: { enabled: true }`) gives server runtime WITHOUT SSR
- oRPC makes `createServerFn` redundant (both provide type-safe RPC)
- `@vitejs/plugin-react-swc` works with Start (despite docs showing non-SWC)

### Verification
- `pnpm install` ✅
- `vite dev` → localhost:3000 ✅
- `tsc --noEmit` → 0 errors ✅

### Decisions
- See ADR-007 in decisions.md

## Session 14 — 2026-04-26: Finalisasi SPA Auth & PR ke `dev`

**Branch:** `feat/auth`
**PR:** https://github.com/alarwasyi98/edara/pull/9 (`feat/auth` → `dev`)

### What Happened
Blank page on dev server fixed. Three root causes found and resolved:
1. **Schema duplication in `users.ts`** — `userId` field defined twice, `userIdx` index defined twice, `t.userId` appeared twice in unique index → TypeScript error TS1117 blocked build entirely
2. **Better Auth `baseURL` invalid** — `auth-client.ts` used relative path `'/api/auth'` instead of absolute URL → runtime crash before React rendered
3. **Server deps leaked to client bundle** — `src/routes/api/auth/$.ts` imported `auth` → `db` → `neon()` → TanStack Router bundled server-side code into client

### Fixes Applied
- Removed duplicate properties in `src/server/db/schema/users.ts`
- Changed `baseURL` to `window.location.origin` in `src/lib/auth-client.ts`
- Deleted `src/routes/api/auth/$.ts` (SSR-only pattern incompatible with SPA)
- Updated `src/routeTree.gen.ts` to remove `/api/auth/$` references
- Added try/catch + error check in `getSession()` for graceful `null` return
- Added `.playwright-mcp/` to `.gitignore`

### Decisions
- Removed API auth route entirely (SSR-only, not SPA-compatible)
- `window.location.origin` as baseURL (safe in SPA, per Better Auth docs)
- `getSession()` returns `null` on error (route guard handles redirect)
- Created backup branch `feat/auth-backup-2026-04-26`

### Verification
All CI checks passed: format ✅, typecheck ✅, lint ✅ (8 warnings baseline), build ✅, tests ✅ (11 tests, 2 files). `/sign-in` and `/sign-up` render correctly. Route guard redirects work.

### Better Auth Audit (~40% complete)
- ✅ Auth schema correct (`user`, `session`, `account`, `verification`)
- ✅ Separation of concerns: Better Auth = identity, `user_school_assignments` = tenancy/RBAC
- ✅ Client layer clean and testable
- ✅ oRPC middleware scaffolding correct pattern
- ❌ No server runtime executing `betterAuth()` instance
- ❌ `src/lib/auth.ts` accessible from client (should be `src/server/`)
- ❌ `userSchoolAssignments.userId` missing FK to `user.id`
- ❌ Auth schema missing explicit `hashedPassword` column
- ❌ Admin router missing role checks
- ❌ Drizzle migration drift: snapshot has `user_id`, SQL `0000` still has `clerk_user_id`

## Session 13 — 2026-04-25: Better Auth Recovery on `feat/auth`

### What Happened
Recovery of Better Auth migration on `feat/auth` branch. White screen resolved, auth routes made consistent, CI checks passing, preview production bundle accessible.

### Key Fixes
- Removed duplicate `src/routes/auth/*` routes (kept canonical `/sign-in`, `/sign-up`, `/forgot-password`)
- Regenerated `src/routeTree.gen.ts` after route cleanup
- Added route guards: `/_authenticated` redirects to `/sign-in?redirect=...`; public auth pages redirect logged-in users to `/`
- Replaced mock auth (Zustand/cookie) with Better Auth client calls in sign-in/sign-up forms
- Removed `createServerFn` dependency (not compatible with Vite SPA)
- Removed `tanstackStartCookies()` plugin (leaked `@tanstack/start-server-core` to client build)
- Added `.worktrees` ignore for ESLint, Prettier, `.gitignore`
- Generated forward migration `drizzle/0002_next_power_pack.sql` for Better Auth tables

### Root Causes
1. Two auth route systems coexisted (root `(auth)` + new `src/routes/auth/*`)
2. API/import patterns assumed full TanStack Start runtime (not SPA)
3. Local worktree polluted lint results
4. Previous "fix" commits contained mismatched APIs
